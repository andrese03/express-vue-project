# App

## Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v8.x.x
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community) v3.4

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

Then, go to to the `./client` folder inside the project and run the following command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

After the dependencies are installed, run this command in the root project:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will run both the backend and frontend project. Make sure you have your mongodb instance running.

Have fun!
